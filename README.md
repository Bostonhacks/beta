# BostonHacks Beta - Landing Page Fall 2018
This is the landing page for BostonHacks (will live at bostonhacks.io).

It is an ejected react starter project. Even though this is a static site, we're doing this so that we can be modern and learn about some cool 22nd century shiz. Maybe someday we'll add features that actually necessitate all this crazy JS?

## Setup

Make sure you have recent versions of node and yarn. You can install yarn with the node package manager (npm), which comes by default with installations of node.

Side note: I like to use a node version manager so I can easily change between versions as necessary; there are several of these such as nvm and nodenv.
